## Problem 1

### This page has infomation about me!

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="image/image.jpg" style="width:75%"></div>

Now I'm a first-year student majoring in Biostat at Mailman School of Public Health, CUMC. It's a fresh start for me, I'd love to find out what I can achieve here.\

### Links for further understanding!

I have my [Resume](resume.html) here! Hope you can learn something about me.\

## Problem 2

### Now let's generate some graphs!

The dataset I used is gathered from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association) National Climatic Data Center. I do some research on the connection between `temperature`, `snowfall` and `precipitation`. Click the link below for graphs.\
